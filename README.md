🌟 Meet Riya – My Personal AI Assistant, Powered by Python! 🌟

I’m excited to share the launch of my custom-built digital assistant, Riya! Developed in Python, Riya is designed to make everyday laptop tasks simpler, faster, and more efficient by handling voice-activated commands. Here’s a look at what Riya can do:

✅ Smart Task Execution: Open apps like YouTube, Google, and Stack Overflow instantly, or launch tools like Word, Excel, and Visual Studio Code – all with a single voice command.

✅ Information Retrieval: Riya can search Wikipedia, provide summaries, and share results – no typing needed!

✅ Media & Music Management: Riya can play music directly from a specified library, adding a personalized touch to productivity.

✅ Real-Time Updates: Get the current time, schedule reminders, or even check emails! Riya is designed to adapt to your daily needs.

✅ Hands-Free Emailing: Need to send a quick email? Just tell Riya who and what to send, and it’s done.

Riya’s purpose is simple: to streamline tasks, organize workflows, and free up time for more creative and strategic work. Thanks to advanced speech recognition and text-to-speech capabilities, Riya seamlessly responds to natural voice commands, making the interaction feel intuitive and personalized.

Proud of this project and looking forward to expanding its functionalities further! 🌐✨
